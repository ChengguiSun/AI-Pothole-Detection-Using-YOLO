# AI Pothole Detection Using YOLO

### [YOLO: Real-Time Object Detection](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/)

This project uses [AlexeyDB's fork](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet) of Darknet Yolo that runs on Windows and Linux. This [tutorial](https://timebutt.github.io/static/how-to-train-yolov2-to-detect-custom-objects/) was used as a basis to train the model to detect potholes. I found it beneficial to run through the tutorial completely once before starting on the potholes dataset. The modified files can be found in [this Github repository](https://github.com/CityofEdmonton/AI-Pothole-Detection-Using-YOLO).
